#Flask Foundation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation.png)](https://travis-ci.org/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation)

Documentation is located at [https://jackstouffer.github.io/Flask-Foundation/](https://jackstouffer.github.io/Flask-Foundation/)

Flask Foundation is a solid foundation for flask applications, built with best practices, that you can easily construct your website/webapp off of. Flask Foundation is different from most Flask frameworks as it does not assume anything about your development or production environments. Flask Foundation is platform agnostic in this respect.

Built off of the [bootstrapy project](https://github.com/kirang89/bootstrapy)

Best practices were learned from:
* [Creating Websites With Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/10/building-websites-in-python-with-flask/)
* [Getting Bigger With Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/11/getting-bigger-with-flask/)
* [Larger Applications With Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/packages/).
